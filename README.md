# FP4-proposal
Project Proposal is due 2015-04-08 at 8am

Produce a plan for your final project, and prepare an in-class presentation.

Ask questions, as always, [on piazza!][piazza]

## Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be on github, as a pull request of this very file. Below is a template proposal report.

You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.
The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]



## In-Class Presentation Instructions
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation. **Presentations will be Wednesday, April 8** (and Friday, April 10 as necessary). The presentation material is due on April 8 by 9 am for everybody. [See piazza for full schedule.][piazza]

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link at the bottom of this report. The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin. 

(Template follows. You may delete this line and all above it. Please edit the following template to create your report.)

# Project Title: Racket-QA
### Problem Statement

* Racket has a unit testing library RackUnit which can run test cases and test suites, but it seems incomplete as an API from a QA Engineer standpoint and its documentation is poor. We want to create some well-documented user-friendly utilities that a QA Engineer could use in Racket.
* Someone can use RackUnit to run tests, but can't send those results out to a QA team and can't schedule when the tests should be run.
* Along with encouraging test-driven development, there should also be standards established for documentation. Racket-Doc is a component of this project which displays styled text in web pages.
* The above three points are the big picture focus, but in our case we are using bottlenose test cases from this course as the basis of individual test suites to run. The problem with the current Perl test cases is that if people want to test their code on the assignments, they have to test one case at a time manually which is tedious and inefficient. Using RackUnit, all test cases can run at once and the person sees exactly which cases failed and why; running the Perl test cases just say "not ok" which isn't helpful, and those scripts take a while to run.


### Problem Analysis

* Use Higher-Order-Procedures discussed in class. These include procedures such as map, filter, zip, and keeping the substitution model in mind when creating new data from original data through these procedures.
* More could be entered here

### Data set or other source materials

* For the most part the scripts will be working with existing data from files stored on the computer. This is especially true for Bottle-Racket.
* Bottle-Racket takes a source Racket assignment file and a Bottlenose Perl test file from the computer as data. The lines from these files are read as strings, and HOP are used to work with the data as lists of strings. New files will be generated such as the test suite and test area file.
* Test-Capture is a utility that will take the test area files generated from Bottle-Racket to create test-running scripts that save test results to file and can be sent out to a team via email.
* Racket-Doc, James needs to give input on how the data will be retrieved etc.
* QA-Email, will get email body from test results file generated by a test-running script that's used after Bottle-Racket creates a test area file. Yong Cho can give input on how Address Book and Scheduler will work with what kinds of data (e.g. are the Address Book files just simple text files where each line is an email address?)

### Deliverable and Demonstration

* The program will be able to take a bottlenose assignment file, convert it into a test suite, and then make a test-running script for that suite.
* In addition to Bottlenose tests, the program is capable of running any RackUnit test provided by the user.
* The program will present to the user a GUI showing the test result, as well as a file containing the results for the test suite.
* The program will provide an interface to schedule a test to be run automatically with specified test-running script. This feature is targeted mainly for regression testing of a project involving multiple developers.
* The program will present an interface to configure an email database associated with each test, which will be used to send out a scheduled test result upon the user's request.
* Racket-Doc will be able to look through properly formatted Racket code and display it nicely in a web browser (James needs to elaborate on this one)

### Evaluation of Results

- Bottle-Racket will be able to convert a variety of the assignment Perl test case files.
- Scheduler will be able to successfully run test-running scripts in consistent intervals, even when mailing list associated with the test is updated between consecutive test run-ups and when the source code tested is changed.
- Email module will be able to detect when a user enters an incorrect email address or when a database stored in the user's storage is currupted between the program run-ups, and notify the user of the invalid entries.


- Racket-Doc, need James's input on this

## Work Plan and Schedule

An excel spreadsheet representing a calendar will be used as a planner.

First Milestone (04-13)
* Bottle-Racket will be able to convert the first 3 assignments along with freds-db (that one requires loading in definitions from another file).
* Test results can be sent out to the QA Email group by reading in the test result files generated from the test-running scripts created by Test-Capture.
* Racket-Doc, need James's input on this
* User interface and file database for managing and storing mailing lists, as well as sending emails with a test result will be fully functional.

Second Milestone (04-21)
* The program will be able to run both Bottlenose test and other RackUnit test upon users' choice.
* User interface for selecting between a Bottlenose test and other Racket test will be available.
* Test scheduler will be created and tested with capability to send emails automatically after the scheduled test run-up.

## Group Responsibilities

* Roy will work on Bottle-Racket and Test-Capture. Testing of other team members' code to see their progress, and have some involvement with Address Book and Scheduler.
* Yong will work on test scheduler and email components, and possibly creating a UI for configuring and executing non-Bottlenose tests (it is not clear at this point whether a separate UI will be needed for non-Bottlenose tests).
* James will work on Racket-Doc
